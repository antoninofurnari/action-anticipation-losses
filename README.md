# PyTorch Action Anticipation Losses
This repository implements the Verb-Noun Marginal Cross Entropy Loss (VNMCE) proposed in the paper ([download here](http://iplab.dmi.unict.it/furnari/publications/furnari2018Leveraging.pdf)):

`A. Furnari, S. Battiato, G. M. Farinella (2018). Leveraging Uncertainty to Rethink Loss Functions and Evaluation Measures for Egocentric Action Anticipation . In International Workshop on Egocentric Perception, Interaction and Computing (EPIC) in conjunction with ECCV.`

We also report an implementation of the Truncated Top-5 Entropy Loss proposed in the paper:

`Lapin, Maksim, Matthias Hein, and Bernt Schiele. "Loss functions for top-k error: Analysis and insights." Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2016.`

Please see the code for usage examples.
